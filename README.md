# AWS Lab

This is my aws lab repository. I experiment several deployments, components and architecture.

In order for you to run these lab, you need:

- an AWS account.
- Install and configure the AWS Cli: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-prereqs.html
- Install aws-mfa in order to simplify the use of the CLI, if MFA is enabled: https://pypi.org/project/aws-mfa/

Let's have some fun and let me know if have any comments.
